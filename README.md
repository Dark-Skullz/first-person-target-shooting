# first-person-target-shooting
a very simple 2d html5 &amp; js first person shooter, you can use WASD keys to aim, space to shoot.
if you hit the target, it teleports to another position.
you must hit the target as many times as you can, you have 60 seconds.
when the time is up, you will get a notification with the score, the game will freeze.
to restart the game, refresh the page.


good luck!!
